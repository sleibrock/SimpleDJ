#Simple DJ

SimpleDJ was a project created for a Software Engineering final mostly done on 
my own. It's written using Bass.NET and C# with Visual Studio 2012.

##Installing/Compiling

1. Clone it
2. Import it into Visual Studio
3. Grab a copy of Bass.NET (there's a DLL in the repo)
4. Set the reference to the Bass.NET library
5. Compile and run!

A premade binary exists in the repo under the /Debug/ folder. 
I won't be making any new commits to this project.
